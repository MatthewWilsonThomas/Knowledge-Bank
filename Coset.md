A [[subgroup]] $H$ determines the left and right cosets. They are translations of the subgroup $H$ by an arbitrary group element $g$ of the parent group $G$. 

### Definition
- Left Coset: $gH = \{g\cdot h| h\in H\}$ 
- Right Coset: $Hg = \{h\cdot g | h \in H \}$
- 
The left cosets of any subgroup $H$ form a partition of $G$; that is, the union of all left cosets is equal to $G$ and two left cosets are either equal or have an empty intersection. The first case $g_{1}H=g_{2}H$ happens precisely when $g_{1}^{-1}\cdot g_{2}\in H$, i.e. when the two elements differ by an element of $H$. Similar considerations apply to the right cosets of $H$. The left cosets of $H$ may or may not be the same as its right cosets. If they are (that is, if all $g$ in $G$ satisfy  $gH=Hg$), then H is $said$ to be a normal subgroup.
