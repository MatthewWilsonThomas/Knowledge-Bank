### Definition
A subgroup of $G$ is a [[group]] $H$ contained within $G$. It is a subset of the elements with the same group operation. This means that the identity element of $G$ must be contained within $H$, and whenever $h_1$ and $h_2$ are both in $H$ then so are $h_1 \cdot h_2$ and $h_1^{-1}$. 


Given a subset $S$ of the elements in group $G$, the subgroup generated by $S$ consists of all products of elements of $S$ and their inverses. It is the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing the elements of $S$.
