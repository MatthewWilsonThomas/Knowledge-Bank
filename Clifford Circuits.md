#QuantumComputing 

These are Quantum Circuits which are generated by only applying on of:
- Hadamard gates
- CNOT gates
- S gates
to the starting state $\ket{0^n}$, then measuring in the computational basis. 

These gates are not a universal set of gates.

### Clifford Gates
$C_n$ is the set of Clifford gates, which are gates which can be generated using the following gates.

#### Hadamard gate
The Hadamard gate
$$
H=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 1 \\
1 & -1
\end{array}\right]
$$
is a member of the Clifford group as $H X H^{\dagger}=Z$ and $H Z H^{\dagger}=X$.

#### S gate
The phase gate
$$
S=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0 \\
0 & e^{i \frac{\pi}{2}}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
1 & 0 \\
0 & i
\end{array}\right]=\sqrt{Z}
$$
is a Clifford gate as $S X S^{\dagger}=Y$ and $S Z S^{\dagger}=Z$.

#### CNOT gate
The CNOT gate applies to two qubits. Between $X$ and $Z$ there are four options:

The Clifford group is generated by three gates, Hadamard, $S$ and CNOT gates. ${ }^{[4]}$ Since all Pauli matrices can be constructed from the phase $S$ and Hadamard gates, each Pauli gate is also trivially an element of the Clifford group.

The $Y$ gate is equal to the product of $X$ and $Z$ gates. To show that a unitary $U$ is a member of the Clifford group, it suffices to show that for all $P \in \mathbf{P}_n$ that consist only of the tensor products of $X$ and $Z$, we have $U P U^{\dagger} \in \mathbf{P}_n$.

This means the Clifford Group is the normaliser of the Pauli Group. 

### Properties
The order of Clifford gates and Pauli gates can be interchanged. For example, this can be illustrated by considering the following operator on 2 qubits
$$
A=(X \otimes Z) C Z
$$
We know that: $C Z(X \otimes I) C Z^{\dagger}=X \otimes Z$. If we multiply by $C Z$ from the right
$$
C Z(X \otimes I)=(X \otimes Z) C Z
$$
So $A$ is equivalent to
$$
A=(X \otimes Z) C Z=C Z(X \otimes I)
$$
Thus there is an efficient algorithm to compute the measurement statistics from a description of the Stabiliser Generators.
