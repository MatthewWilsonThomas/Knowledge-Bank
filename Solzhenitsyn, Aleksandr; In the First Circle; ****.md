### Summary
Imprisoned during the Cold War after WW2, documents the suffering and philosophical discussions of prisoners in a Sharashka (prison camp for research). From the perspective of a researcher who works on identifying suspects of treason by their voice, one who eventually stops cooperating with the research projects and gets shipped to a much worse prison camp in response. 

### Review
An in depth study of the human condition when placed in a dichotomy, i.e. required to work for the people who imprisoned them. The central character has accepted his fate, while being philosophically set against it.
