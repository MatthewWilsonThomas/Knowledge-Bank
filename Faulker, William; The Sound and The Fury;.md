### Review
Difficult book, not worth reading. The stream of consciousness style is reminiscent of James Joyce, without the coherence of thought (something I never thought I would say w.r.t to Joyce). The temporal discontinuity from the perspective of the narrator makes the first half of the book almost impossible to follow on the first read.
