### Summary
Humbert, a self-diagnosed obsessive peadophile has an obsession with nymphets (beautiful cherubic children with an apptitude to tease/incense his depravities), finds Lolita (Dolores Haze) and begins an obsessive journey centred around her.

### Review
Lolita is a difficult book to write about. The depravity of the subject is masterfully covered the  writing, the first person perspective obscures the horror of what Lolita endures while focussing on Humbert's self-aware emotional anguish at his actions. 

It is depressingly easy to read this book and understand Humbert. This man, who destroys Lolita, the object of his devotion, through the expression of his uncontrolled urges.
The passage concerning his realisation that he loves Lolita (or claims to) in a way beyond his peadophilia but cannot ever be anything but the man who has ruined her life (both his and her words) was a deep passage into the facts of life, on self-control and mistakes made. 

I found it much harder to read the book before the introduction of Lolita, and found Humbert a much more dispicable character before his true obsession began. I suspect that this says more about myself that the novel, something about how I find obsession/purpose admirable, even if that purpose is despicable. 

### Quotes
Humbert:
	The moral sense of mortals is the duty
	We have to pay on mortal sense of beauty
