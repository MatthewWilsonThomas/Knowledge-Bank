### Abelian [[Hidden Subgroup Problem]]
An Abelian Group (commutative group) is a group in which all elements are commutative under the group operation i.e:
$$ \forall a, b \in A; a\cdot b = b\cdot a$$
Abelian Groups are the most general form of a group known to have efficient Quantum Algorithms to solve them, these algorithms take the form of:

### Generalizations
The Abelian HSP generalizes many quantum algorithms and provides a general framework within which their solutions fit.
