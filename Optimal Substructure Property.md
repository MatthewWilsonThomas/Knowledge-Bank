#DynamicProgramming 

Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given complex problem by breaking it into subproblems using recursion and storing the results of subproblems to avoid computing the same results again.
One of the key properties of problem which can be solved by [[Dynamic Programming]] is the Optimal Substructure Property.

This property is utilised to plan dynamic programming calculations that tackle streamlining issues by separating them into more modest subproblems and afterward consolidating the answers for those subproblems to get an answer for the first issue.

### Optimal Substructure
A given problem is said to have **Optimal Substructure Property** if the optimal solution of the given problem can be obtained by using the optimal solution to its subproblems instead of trying every possible way to solve the subproblems.
