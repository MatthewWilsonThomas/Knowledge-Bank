#DataStructure

A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.

### Operations:
-   **Heapify:** a process of creating a heap from an array.
-   **Insertion:** process to insert an element in existing heap time complexity O(log N).
-   **Deletion:** deleting the top element of the heap or the highest priority element, and then organising the heap and returning the element with time complexity O(log N).
-   **Peek:** to check or find the most prior element in the heap, (max or min element for max and min heap).

### Types
Generally, Heaps can be of two types:
1.  **Max-Heap**: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
2.  **Min-Heap**: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
