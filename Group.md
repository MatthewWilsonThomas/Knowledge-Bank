### Definition
A group is a set $G$ together with a binary operation of $G$ (denoted $\cdot$), that combines any two elements $a$ and $b$ to form an element of $G$ ($a\cdot b$) such that the following axioms hold:
1. Associativity: For al $a, b, c$ in $G$, one has $(a\cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$
2. Identity Element: There exists an element $e$ in $G$ such that, for every $a$ in $G$, one has $e \cdot a = a$ and $a \cdot e =  a$. This element is unique and is the identity of the group.
3. Inverse Element: For each $a$ in $G$, there exists and element $b$ in $G$ such that $a\cdot b = e$ and $b \cdot a = e$, where $e$ is the unique identity of the group. For each $a$, the element $b$ is unique; it is the inverse of the element $a$, i.e. $a^-1$
